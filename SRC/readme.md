ArincShieldAutoTest.ino is the sole software file of this project.
Download it in an arduino UNO and you are done !

The same in Nucleo world :
- upload nucleo_main.cpp in your mbed account,
- compile it and download into the nucleo board
- look at the trace messages sent by the nucleo with e.g. hypertherminal
