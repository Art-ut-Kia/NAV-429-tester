# NAV429 Tester

[Nav429](http://www.naveol.com/index.php?menu=product&p=3http://www.naveol.com/index.php?menu=product&p=3) from [Naveol](http://www.naveol.com/index.php?menu=home) is a [shield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino#Shields) that brings [ARINC429](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARINC_429) connectivity to [arduino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino) boards.
It offers 2 x A429 inputs, 1 x A429 output and an [RS422](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-422) RX/TX.
Optionally it can be fitted with a DC/DC converter that permits to power both Nav429 and its host CoM (computer on module) from the 28V power network of an aircraft.

This repository contains all [HW](https://github.com/Art-ut-Kia/NAV-429-tester/wiki/Loop-back-cable) + SW, as well as their description, necessary to perform a self-test of Naveol Arduino Shield Nav429.
The material provided here can also be used as the kickoff of any Nav429-based new project.
